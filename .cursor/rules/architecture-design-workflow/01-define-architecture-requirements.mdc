# Rule: Define Architecture Requirements

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in gathering and documenting comprehensive architecture requirements including business context, technical constraints, and non-functional requirements.

## Process

1. **Receive Design Context**: User provides system or feature to architect
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Gather business and technical requirements
3. **Document Requirements**: Capture NFRs, constraints, and priorities
4. **Validate Completeness**: Ensure all aspects are covered
5. **Save Requirements**: Generate `architecture-requirements-[TARGET_NAME].md` in `/architecture/`

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

**Business Context:**
- What problem does this system solve?
- Who are the primary users?
- What are the key business objectives?

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Expected user load and growth?
- Performance requirements (response time, throughput)?
- Availability targets (99.9%, 99.99%)?
- Security and compliance needs?

**Technical Context:**
- Existing systems to integrate with?
- Technology constraints or preferences?
- Team skills and experience?
- Budget and timeline constraints?

## Requirements Document Structure

1. **Context & Objectives**: Business goals and success metrics
2. **Functional Requirements**: Core capabilities needed
3. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
4. **Domain & Data**: Data models and business rules
5. **Constraints**: Technical, organizational, regulatory
6. **Risks & Assumptions**: Key risks and planning assumptions

## Target Audience

Requirements will be used by architects, developers, and stakeholders.

## Output

- **Format**: Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location**: `/architecture/`
- **Filename**: `architecture-requirements-[TARGET_NAME].md`

## Final Instructions

1. Make requirements measurable and specific
2. Prioritize requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
3. Include acceptance criteria
4. Document assumptions explicitly
