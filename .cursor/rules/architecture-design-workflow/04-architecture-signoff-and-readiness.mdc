# Rule: Architecture Sign-off and Readiness

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in coordinating architecture review, obtaining stakeholder sign-off, and creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key decisions.

## Process

1. **Prepare Review Package**: Compile all architecture documents
2. **Conduct Reviews**: Facilitate stakeholder review sessions
3. **Address Feedback**: Incorporate review comments
4. **Create ADRs**: Document key architectural decisions
5. **Obtain Sign-off**: Get formal approval from stakeholders
6. **Save Documentation**: Store sign-off and ADRs in `/architecture/`

## Review Checklist by Role

### Technical Lead
- [ ] Design meets functional requirements
- [ ] Technical approach is sound
- [ ] Implementation is feasible

### Product Owner
- [ ] Business objectives addressed
- [ ] User needs satisfied
- [ ] Timeline acceptable

### Security Team
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] Compliance addressed
- [ ] Risk mitigation adequate

### Operations

## ADR Template

Save as `/architecture/adr/adr-[YYYYMMDD]-[SHORT_TITLE].md`:

```markdown
# ADR: [Title]

## Status
Accepted/Rejected/Proposed

## Context
What prompted this decision

## Decision
What we decided to do

## Consequences
What happens as a result

## Alternatives Considered
Other options we evaluated
```

## Sign-off Document Structure

1. **Architecture Summary**: Brief overview of chosen design
2. **Review Findings**: Feedback from each stakeholder group
3. **Risk Register**: Identified risks and mitigations
4. **Implementation Readiness**: Prerequisites and dependencies
5. **Approval Signatures**: Stakeholder sign-offs

## Output

- **Sign-off**: `architecture-signoff-[TARGET_NAME].md` in `/architecture/`
- **ADRs**: Individual files in `/architecture/adr/`
- **Updated Design**: Incorporate final feedback

## Final Instructions

1. Ensure all stakeholder concerns are addressed
2. Document decisions with clear rationale
3. Get explicit approval before proceeding
4. Archive all review materials
