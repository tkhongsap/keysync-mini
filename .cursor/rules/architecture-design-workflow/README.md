# Architecture & Design Workflow Cursor Rules

## Introduction

A concise, phase-driven workflow for designing robust system architectures from requirements to approval. It produces clear artifacts (requirements, options, technical design, and ADRs) with validation gates that align stakeholders before implementation begins.

## What This Workflow Does

A comprehensive workflow for designing robust system architectures BEFORE writing any code. This workflow guides you through requirements gathering, architecture options evaluation, technical design, and stakeholder approval - perfect for new systems, major features, or architectural refactoring that requires careful planning and consensus before implementation begins.

## Workflow at a Glance

```
Step 1: Define Requirements → Step 2: Propose Options → Step 3: Create Design → Step 4: Sign-off & Readiness
   (01-define-architecture-    (02-propose-architecture-  (03-create-technical-  (04-architecture-signoff-
       requirements.mdc)            options.mdc)              design.mdc)           and-readiness.mdc)
            ↓                           ↓                         ↓                         ↓
     Requirements Doc            Options Analysis          Technical Specs         ADRs & Approval
```

Each step maps directly to a Cursor rule file as shown below.

## File Mapping

| Step | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **1** | `01-define-architecture-requirements.mdc` | Gather business & technical requirements |
| **2** | `02-propose-architecture-options.mdc` | Compare multiple architecture approaches |
| **3** | `03-create-technical-design.mdc` | Specify detailed technical implementation |
| **4** | `04-architecture-signoff-and-readiness.mdc` | Obtain stakeholder approval & ADRs |

## When to Use This Workflow

✅ **Use this workflow when:**
- Starting a new system or major component from scratch
- Planning significant architectural changes or migrations
- Evaluating technology choices with major implications
- Needing stakeholder alignment before implementation
- Designing for specific NFRs (performance, scale, security)

❌ **Consider other workflows when:**
- Building features with clear requirements (→ PRD-Driven Workflow)
- Reviewing existing code quality (→ Review-Driven Workflow)
- Improving existing code structure (→ Refactoring Workflow)

## Overview

This workflow provides a systematic approach to architecture design using AI assistance, breaking down the complex process of system architecture into manageable phases with clear deliverables, validation gates, and stakeholder involvement.

## Workflow Structure

The architecture-design workflow consists of four sequential phases that guide you through a complete architecture design process:

### 1. `01-define-architecture-requirements.mdc` - Requirements Gathering
**Purpose**: Capture comprehensive business, technical, and operational requirements

```

### Document Structure
Each architecture document includes:

- **Requirements Document**: Business context, NFRs, constraints, success criteria
- **Options Analysis**: Multiple approaches with trade-offs, diagrams, and recommendations
- **Technical Design**: Implementation-ready specifications with detailed guidance
- **Sign-off Record**: Stakeholder approvals, checklists, and governance documentation
- **Decision Records**: Rationale and context for key architectural choices

## Key Features

### Systematic Approach
- **Structured Process**: Four-phase workflow ensures comprehensive architecture coverage
- **Validation Gates**: Prerequisites and quality checks prevent incomplete designs
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Clear roles and responsibilities for all participants

### Comprehensive Analysis
- **Multi-Option Evaluation**: Compare different approaches with clear trade-offs
- **NFR-Driven Design**: Explicit mapping of requirements to design decisions
- **Risk-Aware Planning**: Identification and mitigation of technical and business risks

### Implementation Ready
- **Detailed Specifications**: Technical designs ready for development teams
- **Clear Interfaces**: API contracts, data models, and component boundaries
- **Operational Readiness**: Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance considerations

### Decision Transparency
- **Architecture Decision Records**: Documented rationale for key choices
- **Traceability**: Clear links from requirements through design to implementation
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Formal review and approval processes

## Best Practices

### Requirements Gathering
1. Always start with business goals before technical requirements
2. Make NFRs measurable with specific targets (e.g., "< 200ms response time")
3. Document constraints early - they shape all design decisions
4. Include both current and future scale requirements
5. Get stakeholder agreement on priorities and trade-offs

### Architecture Design
1. Start simple - evolve complexity only when proven necessary
2. Design for the 80% case, not edge cases
3. Prefer proven patterns over novel approaches
4. Make boundaries explicit with clear interfaces
5. Design for observability from the start

### Documentation
1. Keep diagrams minimal and focused on one concern
2. Use consistent notation (C4, UML, etc.)
3. Version control all architecture artifacts
4. Link decisions back to requirements
5. Update docs as implementation evolves

### Stakeholder Management
1. Tailor communication to audience expertise level
2. Use visual aids for complex concepts
3. Provide clear trade-off analysis for decisions
4. Get explicit sign-off at each phase
5. Document dissenting opinions and concerns

## Environment Setup

### Required Directory Structure
Ensure these directories exist in your project:
```
/architecture/          # Architecture artifacts and documents
/architecture/adr/      # Architecture Decision Records
```

### Prerequisites
- Clear project scope and business context
- Identified stakeholders and decision makers
- Access to business requirements and constraints
- Understanding of existing system landscape

## Performance Metrics

Track workflow effectiveness with these metrics:

### Process Metrics
- Time from requirements to approved design
- Number of design iterations required
- Stakeholder review cycles needed
- Percentage of requirements addressed

### Quality Metrics
- Post-implementation design accuracy (actual vs planned)
- Number of architecture changes during development
- Technical debt introduced vs avoided
- System performance vs design targets

### Team Metrics
- Developer understanding of architecture (survey)
- Time to onboard new team members
- Architecture documentation usage rates
- ADR reference frequency

### Business Metrics
- Feature delivery acceleration post-design
- Reduced rework from clear architecture
- System reliability improvements
- Cost savings from informed decisions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Requirements keep changing during design  
**Solution**: Lock requirements at phase gates, document changes as new versions, assess impact before accepting changes

**Issue**: Cannot generate distinct architecture options  
**Solution**: Vary optimization dimensions (cost vs performance vs simplicity), consider buy vs build, explore different deployment models

**Issue**: Stakeholders don't understand technical designs  
**Solution**: Use layered documentation (executive summary → technical details), provide analogies, conduct walkthrough sessions

**Issue**: Design seems over-engineered  
**Solution**: Apply YAGNI principle, design for current + 1 year needs, plan evolution path instead of building everything upfront

**Issue**: Missing critical requirements discovered late  
**Solution**: Use requirement checklists, review similar systems, conduct threat modeling, perform capacity planning exercises

**Issue**: Cannot get stakeholder sign-off  
**Solution**: Address specific concerns individually, provide proof-of-concepts, offer phased implementation, escalate to sponsors

**Issue**: Technical design doesn't align with existing systems  
**Solution**: Map integration points explicitly, validate with platform teams, consider adapter patterns, plan migration strategy

**Issue**: Performance requirements seem impossible  
**Solution**: Challenge requirements with data, propose tiered SLAs, consider caching strategies, evaluate specialized technologies
