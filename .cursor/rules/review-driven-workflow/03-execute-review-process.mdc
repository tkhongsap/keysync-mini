# Rule: Execute Review Process

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in executing review tasks systematically, leveraging specialist reviewers and documenting findings comprehensively.

## Process

1. **Load Review Tasks**: Read from `/reviews/review-tasks-[TARGET_NAME].md`
2. **Execute One Sub-Task**: Process tasks one at a time
3. **Leverage Specialists**: Use appropriate reviewers (@code-reviewer, @security-reviewer, etc.)
4. **Document Findings**: Record issues with evidence and recommendations
5. **Update Progress**: Mark tasks complete and pause for user confirmation
6. **Generate Report**: Save findings in `review-report-[TARGET_NAME].md`

## Task Execution Protocol

**One sub-task at a time:**
1. Select next uncompleted sub-task
2. Perform the review analysis
3. Document findings with file references and line numbers
4. Mark sub-task as complete `[x]`
5. Pause and wait for user approval before continuing
6. When all sub-tasks under a parent are complete, mark parent `[x]`

## Finding Documentation Format

For each finding:
```markdown
### [SEVERITY]: [Issue Title]
**File**: `[FILE_PATH]` (Line [LINE_NUM])
**Category**: Security/Performance/Quality/Architecture

**Description**: 
What the issue is and why it matters

**Recommendation**:
How to fix it

**Example**:
```code
// Current problematic code
```
```code
// Suggested improvement
```
```

## Severity Classifications

- **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks
- **HIGH**: Performance issues, bugs affecting functionality
- **MEDIUM**: Code quality issues, maintainability concerns
- **LOW**: Style issues, minor improvements

## Output

- **Format**: Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location**: `/reviews/`
- **Filename**: `review-report-[TARGET_NAME].md`

## Final Instructions

1. Process one sub-task at a time with user approval
2. Provide specific evidence for each finding
3. Include actionable recommendations
4. Maintain task list accuracy
5. Focus on high-impact issues
