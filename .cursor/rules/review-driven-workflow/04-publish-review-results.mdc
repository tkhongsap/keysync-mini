# Rule: Publish Review Results

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in publishing review results to GitHub/GitLab and creating final documentation for stakeholders.

## Process

1. **Load Review Report**: Read from `/reviews/review-report-[TARGET_NAME].md`
2. **Format for Publishing**: Convert findings to platform-specific format
3. **Create Issues**: Generate GitHub/GitLab issues for critical findings
4. **Generate Documentation**: Create executive summary and technical guide
5. **Archive Materials**: Store all review artifacts for future reference

## Publishing Options

### GitHub Integration
Create issues for:
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- High-priority bugs
- Performance bottlenecks

Issue format:
```markdown
## [SEVERITY]: [Issue Title]

**File**: `[FILE_PATH]`
**Category**: [Category]

### Problem
[Description of the issue]

### Recommended Solution
[How to fix it]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Issue resolved
- [ ] Tests added
- [ ] Code reviewed
```

### GitLab Integration
Similar format, using GitLab API for issue creation and merge request comments.

## Documentation Outputs

### Executive Summary
- Key findings overview
- Business impact assessment
- Priority recommendations
- Resource requirements

### Technical Implementation Guide
- Detailed fix instructions
- Code examples
- Testing requirements
- Validation steps

## Archive Structure

```
/reviews/[TARGET_NAME]/
├── review-plan-[TARGET_NAME].md
├── review-tasks-[TARGET_NAME].md
├── review-report-[TARGET_NAME].md
├── executive-summary-[TARGET_NAME].md
└── implementation-guide-[TARGET_NAME].md
```

## Final Instructions

1. Prioritize critical findings for immediate action
2. Create trackable issues with clear acceptance criteria
3. Provide both executive and technical documentation
4. Archive all materials for audit trail
