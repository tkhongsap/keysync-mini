# Test Generation Workflow Cursor Rules

## Introduction

An end-to-end workflow for building and maintaining meaningful test coverage. It analyzes code to derive test requirements, generates reliable tests, plans complex QA initiatives, and sustains quality with continuous execution and monitoring.

## What This Workflow Does

A systematic workflow for creating comprehensive test coverage through intelligent test generation and maintenance. This workflow analyzes your code to understand testing requirements, generates appropriate test cases, creates strategic test plans for complex features, and ensures continuous test quality - perfect for achieving robust test coverage whether starting from scratch or improving existing test suites.

## Workflow at a Glance

```
Step 1: Analyze Code → Step 2: Generate Tests → Step 3: Create Plan → Step 4: Execute & Maintain
